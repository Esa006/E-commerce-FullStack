Cleaning Up The Clutter

I've just confirmed the Backpack UI fix was a success! That means I can finally take out the trash and delete that temporary file, "bagpack issue." It was just a copy, anyway, so it's time to keep the codebase lean and tidy.

Acknowledging and Checking

I'm now reviewing the current state, and I've marked everything as complete in task.md, including notifying the user of success. I'm taking a moment to double-check for any loose ends. The user created bagpack/bagpack issue, but given the successful resolution, I will refrain from removing the file unless requested by the user. I plan to simply reply to the user.

Great to hear the UI is back! It looks like the missing storage link was indeed the culprit.

Let me know if you run into any other issues with Backpack or need help with anything else on the project.
