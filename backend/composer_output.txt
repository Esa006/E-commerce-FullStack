Verifying lock file contents 
can be installed on current 
platform.
Warning: The lock file is 
not up to date with the 
latest changes in 
composer.json. You may be 
getting outdated 
dependencies. It is 
recommended that you run 
`composer update` or 
`composer update <package 
name>`.
- Required package 
"spatie/laravel-backup" is 
not present in the lock file.
This usually happens when 
composer files are 
incorrectly merged or the 
composer.json file is 
manually edited.
Read more about correctly 
resolving merge conflicts htt
ps://getcomposer.org/doc/arti
cles/resolving-merge-conflict
s.md
and prefer using the 
"require" command over 
editing the composer.json 
file directly https://getcomp
